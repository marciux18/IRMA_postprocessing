# IRMA_postprocessing
This repository will have multiple scripts that I made to process the outputs of IRMA (CDC).
1) IRMAscript.sh --> this script should be executed in the directory where all IRMA output folders are. It will ask you if you are running it there, if yes type "yes" else it will tell you to change directory. It will look through all the tables and output a "mapping_stats.xls" and a "segments_validation.txt" files. The mapping_stats.xls file will output the Sample name, Minimum coverage, Maximum coverage, Average coverage, Minimum quality, Maximum quality, Average quality and percentage of Missing sites for each segment. The segments_validation.txt file will check if the Average quality is below 30 and if the Missing sites are above 10%. In this case the segment will be considered Fail, else it will Pass.
